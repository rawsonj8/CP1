# Final Exam Winter 2019

This is the final exam for CS 260 Winter 2019.

To take this exam, you will time yourself for three hours. You may stop the
timer if you need to take a short bathroom or snack break. If an emergency
occurs, please stop the timer and contact me once you've handled the emergency.

You may take this exam on any computer you are comfortable with and in any
location you prefer. The exam is open note and open Internet. You can use any
online material. You can use code I have written and code you have written. The
only restrictions are that you may not talk to others about the exam, you may
not get help from another person, and you may not copy solutions directly from
sites that provide an exact solution to the problems I give you (e.g. a Stack
Overflow solution).

# Starting the final exam

To start the final exam, you must follow this [GitHub Classroom
link](https://classroom.github.com/a/nuho2jV0). This will create a private
repository for you using our classroom site. We will only grade repositories
created and submitted this way.

Once you "Accept the assignment" on GitHub Classroom, it will create a new
repository for you and grant you access to it on GitHub. In order to start
working on the lab, simply clone the repository to your laptop or other working
environment.

# Code in this exam

There are four directories with problems for this exam. Each one has its own
README file. Be sure you can get the code that is provided running before
attempting the problem. If you have any difficulty getting the code running that
is provided, please contact me. However, if you have difficulty with your own
code, you should debug it on your own.
